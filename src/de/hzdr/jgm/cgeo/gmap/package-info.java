 * This package provides Generalized Map functionality with high-level access.
 * Some functionality is provided, but not yet implemented. Thus, calling such functions will throw a NotImplementedException.

 * The complete package is library free. Nevertheless, some functions using the library

 * for linear algebra computations are still included, but commented out.
